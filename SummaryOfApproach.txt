Summary of Apporach

First step was to test if i could send well formatted json text and write it back to the console.

then i set up a simple json text and tested.

Next, the program would need to extract all the attributes within the JSON. I test by check the amount of fields read is the same as the amount of fields within the JSON object.

The next step: i thought of what would be the difference between primitive fields and non-primitive fields.
I deduced that i can get the properties of each field and check if it is a complex type.
i then created a method that would return a boolean based on if the field is a complex type or not. I can not do that with JObject but if i cast the fields to JTokens with is a
type derived from JObject, i would be able to tell if a field is a complex one or not.

After that i create a temporary array the hold the fields in the order. I keep two pointers one for the back end of the array and the other for the front end of the array. 
All complex fields are sent to the back of the array and primitive fields sent to the front of the array.

after the sort, a Json object is recreated using items in the array in the order.
